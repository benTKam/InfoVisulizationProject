Using a scatterplot graph visualization can improve movie producers' understanding of their viewers' preferences and
desires. By incorporating this technique during production, they can pinpoint popular genres and emerging trends,
which can inspire more compelling and captivating plotlines. Ultimately, this approach can prevent wastage of
valuable resources, such as time, effort, and money, in case a movie fails to attract an audience.


The only installation requirements to properly view this scatterplot will be Visual Studio Code.


Some lesson learned before creating a scatterplot using D3:
1. Understand the data before creating a scatterplot. Know the value range and identify outliers.
2. Map data to visual elements in a scatterplot (e.g., position, size, color).
3. Implement interactive elements in a scatterplot, such as tooltips and zooming, while avoiding overwhelming
viewers.
4. Optimize performance in scatterplots with a large number of data points, using tools such as web workers
and data clustering.
5. Consider design and aesthetics when creating a scatterplot, including an appropriate color scheme and easy-
to-read font.
